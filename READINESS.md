# TYPELL Component Readiness Assessment

**Standard:** [Component Readiness Grades (CRG) v1.0](https://github.com/hyperpolymath/standards/tree/main/component-readiness-grades)
**Assessed:** 2026-03-01
**Assessor:** Jonathan D.A. Jewell

**Current Grade:** C

## Grade Reference

| Grade | Name                  | Release Stage      | Meaning                                              |
|-------|-----------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| X     | Untested              | —                  | No testing performed. Status unknown.                |
| F     | Harmful / Wasteful    | —                  | Reject, deprecate, or delegate.                      |
| E     | Minimal / Salvageable | Pre-alpha          | Barely functional. Needs redesign or major work.     |
| D     | Partial / Inconsistent| Alpha              | Works on some things but not systematically.         |
| C     | Self-Validated        | Beta               | Dogfooded and reliable in home context.              |
| B     | Broadly Validated     | Release Candidate  | Tested on 6+ diverse external targets.               |
| A     | Field-Proven          | Stable             | Real-world feedback confirms value. No harm in wild. |

| Component           | Grade | Release Stage      | Evidence Summary                              | Last Assessed |
|---------------------|-------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------|
| `example-command`   | X     | —                  | Not yet tested.                               | 2026-03-01      |
| `another-feature`   | X     | —                  | Not yet tested.                               | 2026-03-01      |

## Detailed Assessment

<!-- For each component above grade X, add a detailed section: -->

<!--
### `example-command`

- **Grade:** C (Beta)
- **Last assessed:** 2026-03-01
- **Evidence:** [Describe what was tested and what happened]
- **Known limitations:** [What doesn't work or hasn't been tested]
- **Promotion path:** [What's needed to reach the next grade]
- **Demotion risk:** [Low/Medium/High — what could cause a downgrade]
-->

## Notes

- Grades are per-component, not per-project.
- Grade A does not mean perfection — it means demonstrated value in the field.
- Grade F includes opportunity cost — maintaining something when a better tool exists.
- Grades can be skipped if evidence supports it (e.g., X → C if dogfooded immediately).
- Review all grades before each release and at least once per release cycle.
- See the [full CRG standard](https://github.com/hyperpolymath/standards/tree/main/component-readiness-grades) for complete definitions, evidence requirements, and transition criteria.
